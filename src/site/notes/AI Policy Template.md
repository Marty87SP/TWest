TrailWest recognizes the increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) internally and externally and wants to establish a policy to govern the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies within the company.
#### Guiding Principles    
We shall incorporate AI into our business to serve our team and our customers and will pivot if the team feels these priorities have been reversed. More specifically, we shall use AI in a way that fosters learning and empowerment.

We shall incorporate willingness to incorporate AI into the specific role of the employee into our hiring and promotion criteria.

We recognize that an AI-infused environment is fluid and that the shelf life of AI-related policies is short. This is not only to say that technology changes quickly. We desire to see our human resources adapt and grow also. As adoption and learning occurs, our AI policies must be amended commensurate with that learning.

All AI technologies developed or used by TrailWest must adhere to existing ethical standards, that promote transparency, accountability, and privacy. Every internal TrailWest user is accountable for their use. Ensure that AI applications comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards. Login credentials should be managed in alignment with TrailWest corporate zero-trust philosophy.

Communicate clearly usage of AI technologies, especially when it affects individuals that might not be aware that AI are operating behind the user interface.
#### Inventory of AI Usage

A complete list of AI software being used, the AI Application Catalog. This inventory should include:

- AI software name and application URL
- Vendor
- Purpose of use
- Level of AI Usage
- Traffic volume and cost estimates (Level 2 and 3)
- Documented use case(s) with agreed-upon guidelines (Level 3)
#### Levels of AI Usage
Any AI application, regardless of Level, must be registered in the AI application catalog.

a. Level 1 - Low-Risk AI Applications

Definition: Low-Risk Applications are **internally** hosted AI systems used for internal tasks and do not impact internal mission critical systems [insert examples].

- Employees can use low-risk AI applications for internal, non-sensitive tasks.
- Employees can share company or customer details as these tools are hosted internally.
b. Level 2 - Moderate Risk AI Applications

Definition: Moderate Risk Applications are **externally** hosted AI systems used for internal tasks and do not impact mission-critical internal systems [insert examples].

- Employees can use moderate-risk AI applications for internal tasks.
- As these tools are hosted externally, employees must be vigilant to **never share** company or customer details with externally hosted AI applications. Add company proprietary details after the output from the external AI application is complete and back on internal systems.
- Customer-facing deployment of AI applications requires approval from the AI Strategy and Governance Team    
- Approval requests must include target user description, as well as traffic volume and cost estimates. Risk assessments must be conducted in collaboration with TrailWest IT. Approvals are likely to include traffic and cost limits that, when exceeded, will trigger vendor contract review or other changes so as to avoid cost inflation and/or vendor lock.

c. Level 3 - High-Risk AI Applications
Definition: High-Risk AI Applications are **internally** hosted AI applications used for mission-critical tasks [insert examples].
- High-Risk Applications are set up with a high degree of collaboration with IT and will have documented use case(s) with agreed-upon guidelines.

#### Responsibilities
IT will be responsible for maintaining the Ai Application Catalog.

AI Strategy and Governance Team: A board, with representation from Product and Operations Group, will be formed to

- Oversee the development, deployment, and monitoring of AI technologies.
- Ensure high-quality and unbiased data for training AI models
- Consider future changes to this policy document
**AI Augmented Development Teams**
TrailWest could have AI development teams to develop and support Level 3 applications. These teams will be empowered with AI-specific development guidelines furnished through the AI Strategy and Governance Team.

**Employee Training and Reporting**
Employees must promptly report any ethical concerns or potential violations related to AI usage promptly to your manager who will notify the AI Strategy and Governance Team.

Employees will be provided a briefing on our AI policy and training on AI cybersecurity best practices.
### Guidelines for AI Incorporated into TrailWest Products
#### Copyright Compliance      
We are committed to respecting intellectual property rights and adhering to copyright laws. To ensure compliance:

- Only sanctioned and licensed data will be used for AI training
- Regular audits of training data sources will be conducted at a cadence prescribed by the AI Strategy and Governance Team

- Opt-out mechanisms for users who do not want their data used for AI training
- Regular updates to clients about AI features and their data implications

#### Explainability and Avoiding the "Black Box Effect"
To promote trust and understanding, we strive to make our AI systems as explainable as possible:
- Implement "explainable AI" techniques into our user interfaces
- Offer detailed documentation on AI methodologies used in our products
- Conduct regular reviews to improve the explainability of our AI features

#### Data Privacy and Security
Protecting user data is paramount in our AI development:

- Strict adherence to data protection regulations
- Implementation of data minimization principles in AI training â€“ only collect and process the minimum amount of personal data necessary to achieve the specific purpose.
- Regular security audits of AI systems and data storage
- Encryption of sensitive data used in AI training and deployment
#### Violations
Violations of this policy are considered extremely serious and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract, as well as potential legal consequences.
