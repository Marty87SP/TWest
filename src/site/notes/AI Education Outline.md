## AI Education
#### Goals
1. Establish awareness of AI capabilities and common language.
2. Explain the core components of AI such as what is an AI Language Model? What is the
difference between generative and summary AI, and what is the difference between internal
open source AI versus proprietary AI?
3. Embed empowerment into every lesson.
#### AI Basics
* AI Explosion: you might think AI has suddenly burst on the scene but it has been
developing slowing for a long time in the background. Remember the day you first heard
about ChatGPT?
* I Think I Know About AI. At the heart of almost all AI is the Large Language Model.
This is not just a typical database. LLM is fundamentally different and means you can generate human or computer language, and analytically do things that have always been hard to do like find out what is missing.
* Hallucinating Can Be Either Dangerous Productive. Difference between generative AI and summary AI and when to use which.
* DIYAI. Want to DIY AI? Sites like Hugging Face have hundreds of thousands of open
source to download and setup...often for free.
#### AI Cyber Attacks Part 1
* AI-enabled attacks can be made more convincing, more real, than before. For example, how generative AI can read social profiles and customize the attack with spooky good precision.
* More Tempting and Realistic Than Ever Before. What how an AI bot can read your social profile and customize a phishing attack to be more convincing, more tempting than ever before. Once you click on a site link, it seems legitimate. Site replicators like Klones and 10Web can replicate a site in minutes. You might not notice the URL is one character different.
* More Than Ever Before. These cyber attacks can be created very easily. You don’t
even need to know the native language of the intended victim. This capability can drive all
kinds of empowering capabilities such as real time chat bot translation between every
language on the earth. But used nefariously, it removes one of the hallmarks of suspicious
spam messages – badly written emails.
#### AI Cyber Attacks Part 2
* Inbound: When using external AI systems, especially generative AI systems, know the risks of
cut and paste. There are many good stories to illustrate this point like the lawyer who used case
citations from AI in his court case only to realize there were fake.
* Your Day in Court Never Happened. This lawyer used a proprietary AI to research a legal cases related to a personal injury case. He thought the cases provided were real but didn’t check. Turned out they were not real but only after presenting them in court as real.
* Know the Trainers. AI is only as accurate as its trainers. When the New York Times sued OpenAI for copyright infringement, the case exposed a look under the cover to understand how the LLM is trained. OpenAI, like a lot of LLMs, are trained using Common Crawl. And Common Crawl, after Google patents, has wikipedia.com, nytimes.com, and latimes.com as its top 3 sources. So, just understand that that the model will have a view of the world driven by its training sources. 
* Outbound: Expand further on how the oxygen source for AI is data. In short story format, illustrate how external proprietary AI is constantly looking for more data and, in response to knowing this desire for data, what will be the users’ ‘conceal reveal ratio’ meaning what data will they provide and what data will they not provide.
* Write Me an NDA Please. Let’s say you want help writing up a new NDA for a project you’re working on. Wrong prompt “write a mutual non disclosure agreement between MyActualCompanyName and TheOtherActualCompanyName. Term is two years. Legal venue is the state of New York. Include the exchange of proprietary information relating to AI policy templates.” This version leaks details to a third party site. There was a recent case of this data leaking back out in subsequent queries. Safe prompt “write a mutual non disclosure agreement between ABC Corp and DEF Corp. Term is two years. Legal venue is the state of TemporaryStateName.” As you review the template offline, replace the names with the actual names.
#### Deep Fakes
* Deep Fakes: Examples deep fake capabilities. Audio and video deep fakes are getting easier to do. A deep fake audio can be made using as little as 3 seconds of your voice. Most the attacks have been recordings of trusted colleagues or someone higher up in the organization asking to transfer funds. So, follow the procedure you already have which probably includes validating the request.
* This technology is now capable of operating in real-time. This means you could think you’re having a conversation with someone you know but you are not. Imagine this scenario, a colleague asks for the transfer. When you push back, he puts a superior on the phone which is also a deep fake! Being aware of this capability is the biggest part of the defense. To defend against this, ask the deepfake caller to produce information that only the person being impersonated would know.
