**Phase 1: Brainstorming AI Project Ideas**  

- Elevate human resources from tedious tasks to human in the loop review
- Focus on cost savings - especially as we grow. Although I've included future revenue producing ideas.
- Keep access to existing systems for data sourcing top of mind for every project.

**Phase 2: Prioritization and Proposal Development (Weeks 3 & 4)**
This phase involves detailed research, feasibility studies, and the creation of comprehensive project proposals. Each proposal should include:  

- **Project Title & Description:** A clear and concise summary of the project.
- **Project Goals & Objectives:** Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals (gated funding model).
- **Data Requirements:** Identification of necessary data sources and their accessibility.
- **Technical Requirements:** Hardware, software, and infrastructure needs. This includes the feasibility of integrating an AI server (on-premise or via secure tunneling to a rented GPU VM).
- **Implementation Timeline:** A realistic schedule for project completion.
- **Resource Allocation:** Estimated budget and personnel requirements. 
- **Risk Assessment:** Potential challenges and mitigation strategies. 
- **Potential ROI:** Estimated return on investment, considering both cost avoidance and revenue generation.
- **Privacy Considerations:** Addressing potential biases, fairness, and privacy concerns.
