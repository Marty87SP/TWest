**Phase 1: Brainstorming AI Project Ideas**  

- Elevate human resources from tedious tasks to human in the loop review
- Focus on cost savings - especially as we grow. Although I've included future revenue producing ideas.
- Keep access to existing systems for data sourcing top of mind for every project.

**1. Risk Management**
- **Fraud Detection:** Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions, reducing financial losses and improving security. Include human in the loop. Include redundant compute pathways.
- **Enhanced Credit Scoring:** Improve credit scoring models using alternative data sources and machine learning techniques to better assess creditworthiness and reduce risk. _Regulatory compliance requirements?_
- **Regulatory Compliance Monitoring:** Use AI to automate compliance monitoring, identifying potential violations and ensuring adherence to regulations. _Regulatory databases and legal expertise requirements?

**2. Operational Efficiency**
- **AI-Powered Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Automate repetitive tasks like data entry, account reconciliation, and loan processing. This could significantly reduce manual effort and improve accuracy.
- **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP):** Automate the extraction of information from various documents (e.g., loan applications, KYC forms) using OCR and NLP. This improves processing speed and reduces manual review. _Requires assessment of document types and data formats.

**3. Customer Experience**
- **AI-Powered Chatbots:**Â Extend [LIVE system hours](https://trailwest.bank/images/2024/10/CRA-File-Branch-Locations-GeoCode_compliant.pdf) by implement intelligent chatbots for customer service, handling common inquiries and providing 24/7 support. This improves response times and reduces the workload on human agents.
- **Personalized Financial Recommendations:** Use AI to analyze customer data and provide tailored financial advice, product recommendations, and investment strategies.
- **Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback:** Analyze customer reviews, social media posts, and surveys to understand customer sentiment and identify areas for improvement

**4. Data Analytics**
- **Customer Churn Prediction:** Develop a model to predict customer churn, allowing proactive interventions to retain valuable customers.
- **Market Trend Forecasting:** Use AI to analyze market data and predict future trends, informing strategic decision-making and product development. _Could require external data sources._
- **Loan Default Prediction:** Develop a model to predict loan defaults, allowing for more informed lending decisions and risk mitigation.

**5. Product Innovation**
- **AI-Powered Investment Platform:** Develop a personalized investment platform that uses AI to manage portfolios and provide investment recommendations. _Requires expertise in financial modeling and investment strategies._
- **Smart Financial Assistant:** Create a mobile app that uses AI to help customers manage their finances, track spending, and achieve their financial goals. _Requires user-friendly design and integration with various financial accounts._
- **AI-Driven Personalized Insurance Products:** Develop insurance products tailored to individual customer needs and risk profiles using AI-powered risk assessment. _Requires actuarial expertise and careful consideration of regulatory requirements._

**Phase 2: Prioritization and Proposal Development (Weeks 3 & 4)**
This phase involves detailed research, feasibility studies, and the creation of comprehensive project proposals. Each proposal should include:  

- **Project Title & Description:** A clear and concise summary of the project.
- **Project Goals & Objectives:** Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals (gated funding model).
- **Data Requirements:** Identification of necessary data sources and their accessibility.
- **Technical Requirements:** Hardware, software, and infrastructure needs. This includes the feasibility of integrating an AI server (on-premise or via secure tunneling to a rented GPU VM).
- **Implementation Timeline:** A realistic schedule for project completion.
- **Resource Allocation:** Estimated budget and personnel requirements. 
- **Risk Assessment:** Potential challenges and mitigation strategies. 
- **Potential ROI:** Estimated return on investment, considering both cost avoidance and revenue generation.
- **Privacy Considerations:** Addressing potential biases, fairness, and privacy concerns.
