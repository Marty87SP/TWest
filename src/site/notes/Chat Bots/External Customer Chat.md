**from Chris E - Nov 18**
Chat – We have a chat feature on our website that has a chatbot option.  We ran the chatbot for a period of time but it was only answering questions correctly about 50% of the time.  The chatbot is not turned off.  If there was a way for AI to help our chatbot, we would like that.
