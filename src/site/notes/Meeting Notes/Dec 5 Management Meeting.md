#### Questions and Comments
1. Be very careful when dealing with other peoples money
2. Kate and Al: setup outbound web query with inspection for sensitive information. Did follow up Abacus chat on the options.

#### Sensitive information detected handling options
## **Option 1: Direct Rejection of Sensitive Queries**

**Description:**  
The system automatically identifies sensitive or personal information within a user’s query and rejects the request outright without processing it further.

**Method:**

- **Detection:** Utilize the LLM to scan the query for predefined sensitive keywords, patterns (like social security numbers, credit card details), or personal identifiers.
- **Response:** Inform the user that their query contains sensitive information and cannot be processed.

**Example Response:**

> _"I'm sorry, but your query contains sensitive personal information that cannot be processed. Please remove any personal details and try again."_

**Pros:**

- Ensures that sensitive data is never processed or stored.
- Simplifies compliance with data protection regulations.

**Cons:**

- May frustrate users who are unaware that their query contains sensitive information.
- Limited flexibility in handling borderline cases.

---

## **Option 2: User Warning and Confirmation**

**Description:**  
The system detects potential sensitive information and prompts the user to confirm or modify their query before processing.

**Method:**

- **Detection:** LLM identifies possible sensitive elements in the query.
- **Response:** Alert the user about the detected sensitive information and request confirmation or revision.

**Example Response:**

> _"Your query appears to include sensitive personal information. Please review and modify your query to ensure your privacy before proceeding."_

**Pros:**

- Provides users with awareness and control over their sensitive information.
- Reduces false positives by allowing user judgment.

**Cons:**

- Adds an extra step in the user experience, which may slow down the process.
- Users might ignore warnings, potentially leading to data processing.

---

## **Option 3: Query Sanitization and Anonymization**

**Description:**  
Automatically remove or anonymize sensitive information from the user’s query before processing.

**Method:**

- **Detection and Processing:** LLM identifies sensitive parts of the query and either removes or replaces them with placeholders.
- **Response:** Notify the user that sensitive information has been sanitized.

**Example Response:**

> _"Your query contained sensitive information, which has been sanitized for your privacy. Proceeding with the search."_

**Pros:**

- Maintains user experience by allowing the search to proceed.
- Protects sensitive information from being processed or stored.

**Cons:**

- May alter the meaning or intent of the user’s query, potentially affecting search results.
- Complex implementation to ensure accurate sanitization without loss of context.

---

## **Option 4: Tiered Access Control**

**Description:**  
Implement different levels of access based on the sensitivity of the information, restricting certain types of queries to verified or authorized users.

**Method:**

- **Detection:** LLM assesses the sensitivity level of each query.
- **Access Control:** Limit processing of highly sensitive queries to authenticated or authorized users only.
- **Response:** For unauthorized attempts, provide an appropriate message or redirect to a secure channel.

**Example Response for Unauthorized Users:**

> _"Your query requires access to sensitive information. Please log in with appropriate credentials or contact support for assistance."_

**Pros:**

- Enhances security by restricting sensitive queries to trusted users.
- Can be integrated with existing authentication systems for seamless user management.

**Cons:**

- Requires robust user authentication and management mechanisms.
- May complicate the user experience for those needing to access sensitive queries.

---

## **Option 5: Logging and Auditing with Human Oversight**

**Description:**  
Automatically log queries containing sensitive information for later review by administrators or compliance officers, without immediate rejection or modification.

**Method:**

- **Detection:** LLM flags queries with potential sensitive information.
- **Logging:** Record the flagged queries in a secure audit trail.
- **Response:** Optionally inform the user that their query is being reviewed.

**Example Response:**

> _"Your query includes information that requires further review to ensure privacy and compliance. We will process it shortly."_

**Pros:**

- Allows for nuanced decision-making by human reviewers.
- Can help improve the system’s detection capabilities over time through analysis of flagged queries.

**Cons:**

- Introduces delays in processing queries.
- Requires additional resources for monitoring and reviewing logged queries.
- Potential privacy concerns regarding the storage of sensitive information, even temporarily.

---

## **Option 6: Contextual Understanding and Adaptive Responses**

**Description:**  
Leverage advanced LLM capabilities to understand the context and intent behind queries, allowing for more intelligent handling of sensitive information based on nuanced analysis.

**Method:**

- **Contextual Analysis:** The LLM evaluates not just the presence of sensitive terms but the context in which they are used.
- **Adaptive Response:** Based on the analysis, decide whether to reject, warn, sanitize, or allow the query, potentially combining multiple strategies.

**Example Response:**

> _If sensitive information is irrecoverably present:_  
> _"Your query contains personal details that cannot be processed. Please remove them and try again."_

> _If contextually safe:_  
> _Proceed with the search normally._

**Pros:**

- Higher accuracy in detecting true sensitivities, reducing false positives and negatives.
- Flexible response mechanisms tailored to the specific query context.

**Cons:**

- More complex to implement and fine-tune.
- May require ongoing training and adjustments to maintain accuracy.
- Possible computational overhead due to deeper analysis.

## **Option 7: Hybrid Approach Combining Multiple Options**

**Description:**  
Combine elements from the above options to create a more robust and flexible system for handling sensitive information.

**Method:**

- **Initial Detection:** Use LLM to scan for sensitive information.
- **Decision Tree:**
    - **If high sensitivity detected:** Reject the query (Option 1).
    - **If moderate sensitivity detected:** Warn the user for confirmation (Option 2).
    - **If low sensitivity detected:** Allow and possibly sanitize information (Option 3).
- **Logging:** Independently log all flagged queries for auditing (Option 5).

**Example Responses:**

- High sensitivity: _"Your query contains highly sensitive information and cannot be processed."_
- Moderate sensitivity: _"Your query includes potentially sensitive information. Please review and confirm to proceed."_
- Low sensitivity: _"Sensitive information detected and sanitized. Proceeding with your search."_

**Pros:**

- Balances security, user experience, and flexibility.
- Allows for nuanced handling based on the severity of sensitivity.
- Comprehensive oversight through logging.

**Cons:**

- Increased complexity in system design and maintenance.
- Requires careful calibration to ensure appropriate responses across different sensitivity levels.

## **Implementation Considerations**

1. **Privacy Compliance:**
    - Ensure that any handling of sensitive information complies with data protection laws like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
    - Minimize data retention and secure any necessary logs.
2. **User Experience:**
    - Strive for minimal disruption to the user experience while maintaining security.
    - Provide clear and helpful messages to guide users in modifying their queries.
3. **System Performance:**
    - Optimize the LLM’s query inspection to maintain fast response times.
    - Consider resource allocation, especially when processing complex queries.
4. **Scalability:**
    - Design the system to handle increasing loads without degradation in performance.
    - Ensure that logging and monitoring mechanisms can scale accordingly.
5. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Regularly update the LLM’s detection capabilities based on new threats or patterns.
    - Incorporate user feedback to refine response strategies and detection accuracy.
